Step - 1 - Introduction -> Give a detailed data description and objective
Step - 2 - Import the data and display the head, shape and description of the data.
Step - 3 - Univariate Analysis -> PDF, Histograms, Boxplots, Countplots, etc..
Find the outliers in each numerical column
Understand the probability and frequency distribution of each numerical column
Understand the frequency distribution of each categorical Variable/Column
Mention observations after each plot.
Step - 4 - Bivariate Analysis
Discover the relationships between numerical columns using Scatter plots, hexbin plots, pair plots, etc..
Identify the patterns between categorical and numerical columns using swarmplot, boxplot, barplot, etc..
Identify relationships between categorical and categorical columns using stacked bar plots.
Mention observations after each plot.
Step - 5 - Research Questions
Times of India article dated Jan 18, 2019 states that “After doing your Computer Science Engineering if you take up jobs as a Programming Analyst, Software Engineer, Hardware Engineer and Associate Engineer you can earn up to 2.5-3 lakhs as a fresh graduate.” Test this claim with the data given to you.
